# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- `execute_query_batch` accepts a `session_id` and keeps that session's
  connection when the batch leaves an explicit transaction open, so `BEGIN`,
  the changes, a verifying `SELECT` and `COMMIT` can each be their own run
  instead of having to be one script. When `session_id` is given the reply
  carries `{ results, in_transaction }`; without one it stays the bare array,
  so older hosts are unaffected.
- `release_session` RPC method, called when the owning editor tab closes.

### Fixed

- A batch that left a transaction open returned its connection to the pool
  as-is. The pool recycles with `RecyclingMethod::Fast`, which resets
  nothing, so the next borrower inherited the open transaction and its
  locks. A connection is now always rolled back before it goes back.

## [1.0.0-rc.4] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- `routine_management` RPC methods — `build_routine_call_sql`,
  `routine_create_template`, `drop_routine` — are now implemented instead
  of falling back to generic, non-PostgreSQL SQL: invalid call syntax for
  functions with `OUT` params, a template missing `LANGUAGE plpgsql`/`$$`
  dollar-quoting, and a bare `DROP FUNCTION name` that can't disambiguate
  overloads (#84).

### Fixed

- PK-binding cluster in `bind_pk_value`/`build_pk_map_predicate`: NULL
  (#78), boolean (#79), and integer-shaped-string (#80) primary-key values
  either hit an `"Unsupported PK type"` catch-all or, for the string case,
  over-coerced a text column's value to `bigint` and tripped a type-mismatch
  error server-side. An empty `pk_map` also built a malformed trailing
  `WHERE` clause with no client-side error (#81). All four now match the
  builtin driver's binding behavior exactly.
- `extract.rs`'s type dispatch was restructured to the builtin's
  `Kind`-first shape (`Simple`/`Enum`/`Array`/`Range`/`Multirange`/`Domain`/
  `Composite`), closing out ~43 PostgreSQL types that previously decoded to
  `null` (or, for `JSONPATH`, a corrupted string): `BIT`/`VARBIT`,
  `MACADDR8`, `XID`/`CID`/`TID`/`XID8`, the eleven `REG*` object-reference
  types, all seven geometric types (`POINT`/`LSEG`/`BOX`/`POLYGON`/`PATH`/
  `LINE`/`CIRCLE`), full-text-search and introspection types
  (`TSVECTOR`/`TSQUERY`/`JSONPATH`/`XML`/`PG_LSN`/etc.), pgvector
  (`vector`/`halfvec`/`sparsevec`), `Kind::Multirange`, `Kind::Domain`,
  `Kind::Composite`, and arrays of all of the above — including arrays of
  the six built-in range types, found during the same pass (#82).
- Write-side binding (`bind_pg_string`) had no branches for pgvector
  literals, raw-SQL-function calls (e.g. `ST_GeomFromText(...)`), or bare
  WKT geometry literals — the first bound incorrectly as an `ARRAY[...]`
  constructor, the other two stored as literal text instead of executing
  server-side (#83).
- Startup scripts had no execution timeout — a script that blocks (an
  advisory lock, `pg_sleep`, a stalled host) wedged pool creation, and
  therefore every RPC needing that pool, indefinitely. Bounded to the
  same 30-second timeout the builtin driver uses (#85).
- Binding an empty JSON array (`[]`) produced the invalid SQL fragment
  `ARRAY[]`, which PostgreSQL rejects for lack of an inferred element
  type. Now binds as the canonical `'{}'` empty-array literal (#86).
- The BYTEA read path base64-encoded the entire value with no size cap and
  a hardcoded `application/octet-stream` MIME type — including a second,
  independently-drifted untruncated copy reachable only via array elements
  and composite fields. Both now cap at the same 10 KB preview size the
  builtin driver uses and sniff MIME from magic bytes (#87), and the same
  cap now applies to the internal planner-statistics blob types
  (`pg_mcv_list`, `pg_dependencies`, etc.), whose macro had drifted onto
  its own untruncated encoder discovered while fixing #87 (#106).
- `get_routines` unconditionally queried `pg_proc.prokind` (PostgreSQL 11+
  only), failing with `column "prokind" does not exist` against
  PostgreSQL 9.x/10. Falls back to the legacy `proisagg`/`proiswindow`
  columns below server version 110000, matching the builtin driver (#88).
- `explain_query` returned the raw EXPLAIN JSON directly instead of the
  `{ engine, format, payload, original_query }` shape the host's plugin
  adapter requires to classify a response as `Raw` — so every EXPLAIN
  result fell through to the generic parsed-plan renderer instead of the
  builtin driver's raw-payload path (#89).
- The rustls `CryptoProvider` was only installed as a side effect inside
  the `require`/`verify-ca` TLS branches; `verify-full` and the
  `prefer`/`allow`/`disable` fallthrough built their TLS config directly,
  with no such side effect, making provider installation depend on branch
  execution order rather than always running first (#90).

## [1.0.0-rc.3] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- Table and column comments (`COMMENT ON TABLE`/`COMMENT ON COLUMN`,
  stored in `pg_description`) are now exposed as an optional `comment`
  field in `get_tables`/`get_columns`, joined via `pg_class`/
  `pg_attribute`. Matches the builtin driver's parity fix. Additive —
  no manifest/capability change, no minimum runtime bump (#74, #76).

### Fixed

- `hstore` columns decoded to `null` instead of a JSON object, since
  `extract.rs`'s type dispatch had no arm for hstore's extension OID
  (which varies per installation and isn't a well-known Postgres
  type). Also fixes the write side: editing an hstore cell previously
  failed with "Cannot bind a JSON object to a non-JSON column" (#68,
  #69, #71).
- Arrays of any custom-OID element type — `enum[]`, `hstore[]`, and in
  practice every array type without a hardcoded fast-path (`numeric[]`,
  `date[]`, `json[]`, `money[]`, `inet[]`, etc.) — also decoded to
  `null`. Adds a generic array decoder that recurses per-element,
  matching the builtin driver's dispatch. Existing hardcoded array
  fast-paths (int2/int4/int8/float4/float8/bool/text/varchar) are
  unaffected (#71, #72).
- The hardcoded array fast-paths decoded the *entire* array to `null`
  if any single element was `NULL` (e.g. `ARRAY[1, NULL]` returned
  `null`, not `[1, null]`), since they decoded via `Vec<T>: FromSql`
  rather than `Vec<Option<T>>: FromSql`. Now preserves the `null` slot
  in its correct position (#73, #75).
- Running `SHOW search_path` (or any `CALL`) from the Console produced
  `syntax error at or near "LIMIT"`, because the Console always sends
  a `limit`/`page` param and pagination was unconditionally appending
  a SQL `LIMIT`/`OFFSET` clause — but PostgreSQL's `SHOW`/`CALL` syntax
  doesn't accept one. `SELECT`/`WITH`/`VALUES`/`TABLE`/`EXPLAIN` do
  accept it and keep real SQL-level pagination (multi-page browsing
  still works for CTEs); only `SHOW`/`CALL` fall back to capping rows
  client-side instead (#70, #77).
- A comment-headed query (e.g. `-- note\nSELECT 1`) was misclassified
  as not returning a result set, silently losing its row data through
  the execute()-and-discard path instead of the fetch-rows path (#77).

### Changed

- Bumped `rustls` from 0.23.43 to 0.23.45, fixing RUSTSEC-2026-0285
  (CVE-2025-61730) — a TLS 1.3 handshake message boundary check.
  Lockfile-only change, no `Cargo.toml` range change.

## [1.0.0-rc.2] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Query, startup-script, and connection-establishment failures now surface
  PostgreSQL's real error message instead of the generic literal string
  `"db error"`. `tokio_postgres::Error`'s own `Display` impl prints that
  fallback for any server-side error (its `Kind::Db` arm); the actual
  message lives in the wrapped `DbError`, reachable via `.as_db_error()`.
  Every call site that stringified the error directly — query execution,
  startup scripts, blob fetch, `SET search_path`, and the connection
  handshake itself (bad database name, bad password) — lost that detail.
  Ports the built-in driver's `format_pg_error` helper and applies it at
  every affected site (#66, #67).

### Changed

- Bumped `rust_decimal` from 1.42.1 to 1.43.0 (backported fixes, perf
  improvements, clippy cleanup; lockfile-only change, no `Cargo.toml`
  range change). Verified `NUMERIC`/`Decimal` round-tripping — including
  negative values, the one behavioral fix in this release — against a
  live PostgreSQL container with no regressions (#65).

## [1.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-09-04

No code changes since `1.0.0-beta.10` — this tag promotes that build to the
`rc` channel. This repo tracks a builtin driver that keeps shipping its own
changes independently (TLS/pool-config semantics, wire-format coverage —
see `CLAUDE.md`'s "Parity gaps beyond SQL text"), so waiting for full
parity before calling a release candidate meant an indefinite `beta` line
chasing a moving target. `1.0.0-rc.1` is the checkpoint instead: parity
gaps discovered from here on are tracked as issues/patches on the `rc`
line (`rc.2`, `rc.3`, ...), not reasons to hold the channel back. New PRs
should use the `prerelease:rc` label going forward (see README's
"Contributing: PR Titles & Versioning").

## [1.0.0-beta.10] - 2026-09-04

### Added

- Configurable connection-pool size via a `poolMaxSize` driver setting
  (default 10, clamped to 1–64, parsed from u64/i64/string with zero/invalid
  → default). Ports the built-in `postgres` driver's configurable pool size
  (TabularisDB/tabularis#681) to the plugin. Motivated by pgBouncer
  (TabularisDB/tabularis#71): against a pooler you want a *small* client
  pool so you don't burn server slots, and previously the only option was a
  recompile. The setting is declared in `.tabularium` and received via the
  `initialize` RPC; an absent/invalid value degrades gracefully to the
  default (10), the built-in driver's pin.

### Fixed

- Restored pool-size parity with the built-in driver. `build_pool` never
  set `max_size`, so deadpool fell back to `PoolConfig::default()` =
  `logical_cores × 2` (up to ~32 on a 16-thread machine) — up to ~3× more
  backend connections per target than the built-in's pinned 10. Pools now
  default to 10 regardless of CPU count, the same gap the new setting
  addresses. The 82-test parity suite compares query results, not
  connection counts, so this latent gap went undetected.

### Changed

- Bumped `deadpool-postgres` from 0.14.1 to 0.14.2 (pulls `deadpool`
  0.12 → 0.13.1, `deadpool-runtime` 0.1 → 0.3.1, `getrandom` 0.2 → 0.4
  transitively). No public-API changes to the pool surface this plugin
  uses; 8/8 live-db tests confirm identical pool/connect/TLS/startup-script
  behavior.
- Bumped `uuid` from 1.24.1 to 1.26.0. Used only for `Uuid` parse/to-string
  in `binding.rs`/`extract.rs` (no generation, no new APIs); 8/8 live-db
  tests pass.
- Bumped `log` from 0.4.33 to 0.4.34.

### Documentation

- Added GitHub Issue Form templates (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`) for the
  Tabularis builtin-to-plugin migration flow: `migration-failure.yml`,
  `capability-gap.yml`, and `bug_report.yml`, plus the `migration` and
  `capability-gap` labels. Pre-filled by the app via query params keyed on
  each form element's id; no separate release impact.

## [1.0.0-beta.9] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Driver icon rendered invisible — `.tabularium`'s badge `color` and the
  icon SVG's `fill`/`stroke` were both `#336791`, so the mark had zero
  contrast against its own badge on every connection using this driver.
  Switched the icon to white so it reads against the fixed badge
  background regardless of app theme.

### Changed

- Bumped `uuid` from 1.24.0 to 1.24.1 (patch release fixing non-ASCII
  character handling in parse diagnostics; no behavioral overlap with
  this plugin's `v4` generation/serde usage in `binding.rs`/`extract.rs`).

## [1.0.0-beta.8] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- Client certificate authentication (mTLS) for PostgreSQL servers requiring
  it (e.g. Google Cloud SQL). `ConnectionParams` already carried `ssl_cert`
  and `ssl_key`, but `build_tls_connector` never read them — every TLS
  branch called `.with_no_client_auth()` unconditionally, so connections
  failed with "connection requires a valid client certificate" the same way
  the builtin driver's `pool_manager.rs` did before it was fixed upstream
  (TabularisDB/tabularis#666). Added `load_client_cert_from_pem`, reusing
  the same `rustls::pki_types::pem::PemObject` machinery as the existing
  `load_roots_from_pem` (rather than reintroducing `rustls-pemfile`, removed
  above for being unmaintained) — `PrivateKeyDer` supports PKCS1/SEC1/PKCS8
  via the same trait. Both TLS branches now present the client cert via
  `.with_client_auth_cert(...)` when `ssl_cert`/`ssl_key` are set, and
  `build_tls_connector` errors clearly if only one of the pair is provided.
- Pool cache key ignored every TLS param (`ssl_mode`/`ssl_ca`/`ssl_cert`/
  `ssl_key`) — `connection_key` matched only on
  `host:port:database:user:startup_script`, so two connections to the same
  target differing only in TLS configuration (e.g. `require` vs.
  `verify-full`, or different client certs) could incorrectly share a
  cached pool and its already-negotiated TLS setup. This wasn't inherited
  from the builtin driver: the builtin's `build_connection_key` already
  keyed on `ssl_mode`/`ssl_ca` before this plugin's `client.rs` was even
  staged, so this was a parity miss during extraction, not a later
  upstream change. Folded all four TLS params into `connection_key`,
  matching the builtin's TLS-param keying.
- `ssl_mode=verify-ca` incorrectly enforced hostname verification —
  `build_tls_connector` wrapped `rustls::client::WebPkiServerVerifier` for
  `verify-ca`, whose `verify_server_cert` unconditionally checks the
  hostname with no way to opt out, making `verify-ca` behave identically to
  `verify-full`. `verify-ca` is supposed to validate the certificate chain
  but skip hostname verification — that's the entire distinction from
  `verify-full` (matches libpq `sslmode=verify-ca` semantics). Added a
  dedicated `VerifyCaCertVerifier`, ported from the builtin driver's
  `src-tauri/src/pool_manager.rs`, using
  `rustls::client::verify_server_cert_signed_by_trust_anchor` directly
  instead. Proved the bug and the fix with a chain-valid cert whose
  hostname deliberately doesn't match the connection target: rejected
  before this fix, accepted after (while a CA-untrusted cert is still
  correctly rejected, and `verify-full` still correctly rejects the
  hostname mismatch).
- MONEY columns always read as `null` — `extract_value` had no case for
  `Type::MONEY`, so it fell through to the generic string fallback, but
  `String`'s `FromSql::accepts` returns `false` for `Type::MONEY` (confirmed
  directly), making that fallback fail every time regardless of the actual
  value. MONEY is listed as a supported numeric type in the README and
  `ddl.rs`'s implicit-cast-compatible group, but reading it back was
  silently broken. Added a `Money` wrapper (`src/extract.rs`) that decodes
  the same 8-byte big-endian i64 wire format `INT8` uses and reuses the
  existing `i64_to_json` JS-safe-integer stringification, matching the
  builtin driver's `extract/advanced_types.rs::Money`.
- `ssl_mode=require`/`verify-ca`/`verify-full` silently allowed plaintext
  connections — `build_pool` never called `cfg.ssl_mode(...)` on the
  `deadpool_postgres::Config`, so the underlying `tokio_postgres::Config`
  kept its own default (`SslMode::Prefer`: negotiate TLS if offered, but
  accept plaintext otherwise) regardless of what this plugin's `ssl_mode`
  was actually set to. A user opting into "TLS or nothing" got an
  unencrypted connection with no error if the server couldn't/wouldn't
  negotiate TLS — a security-relevant gap, not just a correctness one.
  Added `resolve_ssl_mode`, mapping this plugin's `ssl_mode` strings to
  `deadpool_postgres::SslMode` to match the builtin driver's
  `build_postgres_configurations` mapping exactly (`disable`→`Disable`,
  `allow`/`prefer`→`Prefer`, `require`/`verify-ca`/`verify-full`→`Require`),
  and wired it into `build_pool`. Proved the bug and the fix with a live
  test against a real non-SSL PostgreSQL instance: `ssl_mode=require`
  connected successfully before this fix, and now correctly fails.
- `ssl_mode=require` validated the server certificate against the platform
  trust store instead of skipping validation entirely. `build_tls_connector`'s
  own doc comment already said `require` should force TLS "without
  certificate validation," but `needs_cert_validation` only matched
  `verify-ca`/`verify-full` — `require` fell through to the final
  `with_platform_verifier()` fallback, which does validate against the OS
  trust store, defeating the entire point of `require` vs. `verify-full`
  (the standard `require` use case is self-signed certs / private CAs the
  user hasn't configured `ssl_ca` for). Added `NoCertVerifier`, ported from
  the builtin driver's `src-tauri/src/pool_manager.rs::NoCertVerifier`
  (accepts any certificate unconditionally — no chain, hostname, or even
  TLS 1.2/1.3 signature verification), and routed `require` mode to it.
  Proved the bug and the fix live against a real self-signed-cert
  SSL-enabled PostgreSQL instance: `require` failed the TLS handshake
  before this fix, and now connects successfully; confirmed no regression
  in `verify-ca`/`verify-full` (still correctly validate) or `require`
  against a non-SSL server (still correctly fails, per the previous entry).
- `verify-ca` without an explicit `ssl_ca` file silently fell through to
  `with_platform_verifier()` — full OS-trust-store validation — instead of
  erroring, unlike the builtin driver's `build_postgres_tls_connector`,
  which requires an explicit CA file for this mode (platform roots aren't
  used, since macOS's strict EKU check rejects them) and errors clearly
  otherwise. `build_tls_connector` now returns the same class of error when
  `verify-ca` is set with no `ssl_ca`; `verify-full` without `ssl_ca`
  continues to use the platform verifier unchanged, since that's the
  documented distinction between the two modes.

## [1.0.0-beta.7] - 2026-08-17

### Removed

- `rustls-pemfile` dependency. It's unmaintained (RUSTSEC-2025-0134 —
  archived upstream, no CVE) and was our only source of the
  `Security audit` job's `unmaintained` warning below. Its one call site
  (`load_roots_from_pem` in `client.rs`, parsing a user-supplied `ssl_ca`
  bundle for `verify-ca`/`verify-full` connections) migrated to
  `rustls::pki_types::CertificateDer::pem_slice_iter`, the maintained
  replacement the advisory itself recommends — already in our dependency
  tree transitively via `rustls`, so this is a dependency removal, not an
  addition. Verified against a disposable self-signed-cert Postgres
  container (`verify-ca` connects correctly; an invalid PEM file still
  produces the same clear error) and added 3 unit tests for
  `load_roots_from_pem` directly, which had zero coverage before this.

### Fixed

- `Security audit` CI job failed on its first scheduled (cron) run with
  `Resource not accessible by integration` when `rustsec/audit-check`
  tried to file a tracking issue for an informational `unmaintained`
  warning (`rustls-pemfile`, RUSTSEC-2025-0134 — no CVE, just an
  archived-upstream notice). The job's `permissions:` block already had
  `checks: write` from a prior fix (CI publishing its pass/fail status),
  but not `issues: write` — a separate permission the action only
  exercises on cron-triggered runs when it has a warning to report, which
  is why push/PR runs of this same job never surfaced the gap. Added the
  missing `issues: write` permission.

## [1.0.0-beta.6] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- README's header logo/plus-icon and screenshot-gallery images used
  repo-relative `src` paths (`assets/plus.svg`, `assets/screenshots/*.png`).
  GitHub auto-resolves those against the repo's raw-content base, so they
  rendered fine there — but the Tabularium registry serves the README's
  HTML standalone, with no such resolution, so all 6 images 404'd on the
  plugin's registry page once the README actually synced. Switched to
  absolute `raw.githubusercontent.com` URLs, matching the pattern already
  used for `postgresql-icon.svg` and the `.tabularium` `screenshots` array.

### Changed

- `.tabularium`'s `description` rewritten from the internal-facing
  "PostgreSQL plugin driver for Tabularis (parity implementation)" to a
  capability-focused tagline (schemas/tables/views/routines/triggers,
  EXPLAIN plans, type-aware row editing, DDL generation) matching the
  style of the strongest sibling plugin descriptions on the Tabularium
  registry (`mongodb`, `firestore`). Synced the GitHub repo's own
  description field to match, since it was still the old wording.

## [1.0.0-beta.5] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- `.tabularium`: `min_runtime_version: "0.20.0"` — per debba's guidance,
  `tabularis` 0.20.0 is the first release expected to ship the #614/#577
  host-side fixes (capability-driven identifier quoting, etc.) this
  plugin depends on for correct behavior under a non-`"postgres"` driver
  id. Older runtimes will be refused rather than silently misbehaving.
- README header: a plus icon between the Tabularis and PostgreSQL logos
  (`assets/plus.svg`, a lucide-style glyph matching the icon set
  `tabularis`'s own frontend uses) to read as "Tabularis + PostgreSQL" at
  a glance. Self-hosted a copy of the PostgreSQL project's 3-colors logo
  (`assets/postgresql-logo-3colors.png`) instead of hotlinking
  `wiki.postgresql.org`, for the same reliability reason `postgresql-icon.svg`
  is already self-hosted rather than pointed at a third party.
- `.tabularium`: `screenshots` array (7 real captures, not mockups —
  fresh install, database picker, connection form, successful test,
  saved connection, multi-schema browser, and a live data grid showing a
  real enum value) plus a matching "Screenshots" section in the README,
  for the plugin's eventual Tabularium registry submission.
- `.tabularium`: registry-listing metadata fields — `category`, `tags`,
  `license`, `readme`, `homepage`, `documentation_url`, `support.issues_url`,
  `color` — needed for the plugin's eventual Tabularium registry submission.
  These are purely presentational for the registry's plugin-card/detail
  page; the builtin driver's own definition
  (`tabularis`'s `src/hooks/useDrivers.ts`) has none of them, confirming
  they carry no runtime behavior. No version bump warranted.

### Fixed

- README's release badge showed "no releases or repo not found" because
  every published release so far (`v1.0.0-beta.1` through `.4`) is flagged
  `prerelease: true`, and GitHub's `/releases/latest` API — which the
  unqualified `img.shields.io/github/release/...` badge queries — excludes
  prereleases by design. Switched to `img.shields.io/github/v/release/...
  ?include_prereleases`, confirmed rendering `v1.0.0-beta.4` correctly.
- README's installation section and work-in-progress banner were stale:
  described a hypothetical "Automatic (via Tabularis)" install path with
  no registry to install from yet, and the banner's sign-off checklist
  didn't reflect that `tabularis` PR #577's checklist is now fully checked
  (though the PR itself remains open/unmerged). Updated both to describe
  the actual current state — manual install only, registry submission
  pending — and added a "From the Tabularium registry" placeholder section
  matching the pattern used by already-published sibling plugins
  (`tabularis-elasticsearch-plugin`, `tabularis-duckdb-plugin`).

## [1.0.0-beta.4] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Plugin had no `icon` declared in `.tabularium`, so every connection using
  it fell through to the generic fallback icon in the sidebar, connection
  list/cards, and the new-connection engine picker (`getDriverIcon`/
  `getConnectionIcon` in `tabularis`'s `src/utils/driverUI.tsx` only render
  the branded PostgreSQL mark for the literal built-in driver id
  `"postgres"`; anything else needs a manifest-declared `icon` URL).
  Added `postgresql-icon.svg` — the exact same Slonik elephant path/viewBox
  already used by the builtin driver's `PostgreSQLIcon` component
  (`tabularis`'s `src/utils/driverIcons.tsx`), extracted as a standalone
  file and colored to PostgreSQL's brand blue (`#336791`) — and pointed
  `.tabularium`'s `icon` field at its raw GitHub URL, matching the
  mongodb/dynamodb sibling plugins' convention. Verified against the live
  registry schema, which documents `icon` as a hosted image URL.

## [1.0.0-beta.2] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- Keyless-table numeric/temporal `WHERE` binding (port of `tabularis#618`):
  updating or deleting a row in a table with no primary key failed with
  `operator does not exist: numeric = text` (SQLSTATE 42883) whenever the
  identifying column was numeric or temporal, since `bind_pk_value` bound
  those JSON-string values as plain `TEXT` with no coercion. Factored the
  numeric/temporal coercion already used for `SET` binding
  (`bind_pg_string`) into two shared functions and routed `bind_pk_value`
  through them too. See PR #4 for the full TDD trail and live-database
  before/after verification.

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-11

### Changed

- Version scheme reset from `0.1.0` to `1.0.0-beta.1`. The actual target
  is `1.0.0` — Phase 1 byte-for-byte parity is complete per `tabularis`
  PR #577's own "CP-4 Gate Met" status — not an independent `0.x`
  development line, so SemVer's own prerelease mechanism
  (`1.0.0-beta.1` → `-beta.2` → `-rc.1` → `1.0.0`) expresses that
  relationship natively, which a bare `0.1.0` cannot.

## [1.0.0-beta.3] - 2026-08-12

### Added

- `ci.yml`: a `version-suggestion` job posts a PR comment suggesting the
  next tag/version based on the PR title's Conventional Commits type
  (`feat`→minor, `fix`/`refactor`/`perf`→patch, `docs`/`style`/`chore`/
  `test`/`ci`/`build`→no release, `!`/`BREAKING CHANGE:`→major) and a
  required `prerelease:alpha|beta|rc|stable` PR label (missing label fails
  the job — no default channel is guessed). Purely informational, a
  precursor to eventually automating tag/release creation: nothing is
  tagged or released by this job. While the resolved baseline version
  carries a prerelease suffix matching the label's channel, the suggestion
  just increments that stage's counter (`1.0.0-beta.1` → `-beta.2`) rather
  than computing a full patch/minor/major bump — there's no shipped stable
  version yet to protect a SemVer contract against. Re-comments only when
  the PR's *derived classification* changes (type + breaking + channel),
  not on every title edit — tracked via a hidden marker in the comment
  body — and marks the previous suggestion as outdated via GitHub's
  `minimizeComment` API (same as the web UI's "Hide comment → Outdated")
  before posting the new one. Also widens the shared `pull_request:`
  trigger's `types:` to include `edited`/`labeled`/`unlabeled` (previously
  defaulted to `opened`/`synchronize`/`reopened` only, so a title-only edit
  never even re-ran CI). Checked precedent first: no sibling Tabularis
  plugin repo or `tabularis` itself has anything like this; a separate
  internal repo has a fuller PR-title-driven auto-tag/auto-release
  pipeline, but porting that whole pipeline was judged too large a
  behavioral change for this pass.
- Two more CI checks:
  - `release.yml`: a `validate` job gates the build matrix on the pushed
    tag matching `.tabularium`'s `version` field (stripped of the `v`
    prefix) — ported from the `tabularis-elasticsearch-plugin` sibling's
    pattern. This isn't just convention: the registry's own manifest
    schema documents this as a hard rule ("the registry rejects ingests
    whose tag and manifest version disagree"), so this catches the
    mismatch at tag-push time instead of at registry-submission time.
  - `ci.yml`: a `pr-title` job enforces Conventional Commits PR titles via
    `amannn/action-semantic-pull-request`, triggered on plain
    `pull_request` (not `pull_request_target`) since this repo doesn't
    need fork-PR support and the plain event avoids the elevated-
    permission surface entirely.
- CI hardening — deliberately set a higher bar than the sibling plugin
  repos and the org's own documented requirements (no sibling runs
  `cargo audit`; only 2 of 11 Rust siblings gate on clippy/fmt at all):
  - `.tabularium` manifest validation against the live registry schema via
    `@tabularium/cli validate`, catching a malformed manifest automatically
    (we got `name`/`id` wrong once by hand earlier this session).
  - `markdownlint-cli` as an enforced CI job, not a manually-run habit.
  - A release-binary smoke test: pipe a trivial `initialize` JSON-RPC
    request into each freshly-built platform binary and assert a valid
    (non-error) response before it ships in a zip. Skipped for `linux-arm64`
    only, since that leg is cross-compiled and the binary can't execute on
    the x86_64 build runner without QEMU emulation.
  - `cargo audit` (via `rustsec/audit-check`) for supply-chain
    vulnerabilities, on every push/PR and a weekly schedule (catches CVEs
    disclosed after merge against unchanged dependencies).
  - `tests/live_db.rs`: a self-contained live-`postgres:16`-container
    integration test (first top-level `tests/` dir in this repo — existing
    tests are all pure unit tests via the `.rules/rust.md` #4/#5
    sibling-file convention). Covers connect, a basic query, an insert, and
    the `startup_script`/`connection_string` handlers found completely
    uncovered during the security-audit pass — closes the actual biggest
    gap in this repo's CI: nothing previously verified the binary against
    a real database automatically. Deliberately NOT the cross-repo 82-test
    parity suite (that stays a manual/periodic check against `tabularis`,
    per the "Repo Extraction" open question in
    `docs/planning/02-phase-1-plugin-build.md`).
  - Two further hardening ideas — `dependency-review-action` on PRs and
    SBOM generation via `cargo-cyclonedx` — were considered and
    deliberately deferred rather than implemented now; see
    `docs/planning/ci-hardening-deferred.md` for the rationale.

### Fixed

- `execute_query` returned `null` for every PostgreSQL enum column value,
  even when the database genuinely held a non-null value (issue #7).
  `extract.rs`'s `extract_value()` had no explicit match arm for enum
  types (custom-OID types), so they fell into the generic catch-all,
  which tries `row.try_get::<_, String>()` — `tokio_postgres`'s `FromSql
  for String` enforces known-OID checks and can't decode an arbitrary
  enum OID, so this always errored and silently nulled out, with no
  secondary fallback (unlike `try_extract<T>`'s string retry used
  elsewhere in the same file). Pre-existing since Sprint 5; the 82-test
  parity suite never caught it because it only exercises enum *writes*
  (`insert_record`/`update_record` binding) and enum *metadata*
  (`get_columns`'s `pg_enum` lookup), nothing reads an enum value back
  through `execute_query`. Fixed by decoding the raw label bytes directly
  as UTF-8 on `Kind::Enum` columns, ported from the builtin driver's
  `extract/enum.rs::extract_or_null` — bypasses `FromSql`'s OID
  enforcement entirely rather than working around it. Genuinely-NULL enum
  columns still correctly return `null`. Added unit tests for the new
  `EnumLabel` decode path plus a `tests/live_db.rs` regression test
  covering the full RPC round-trip.
- Flaky unit test: `get_or_create_pool_reuses_cached_entry_for_identical_params`
  and `cleanup_idle_pools_evicts_pools_with_no_checked_out_connections`
  both read/write the shared process-wide `POOLS` cache, and Rust's test
  harness runs `#[tokio::test]` fns concurrently — `cleanup_idle_pools`'s
  sweep (which iterates every cached pool, not just its own key) could
  evict the other test's freshly-inserted, still-idle pool mid-assertion.
  Reproduced locally at roughly 1-in-100 runs; hit for real in CI on the
  first push after two other CI fixes made this job the last one standing
  between failure and green. Serialized both tests behind a dedicated
  `tokio::sync::Mutex` (an async mutex, since the guard must span
  `.await` points — a `std::sync::Mutex` guard held across `.await`
  fails `clippy::await_holding_lock`).
- `Security audit` CI job was failing on every run — including, unnoticed,
  the very first `v1.0.0-beta.1`/`v1.0.0-beta.2` release builds — with
  `Resource not accessible by integration` when `rustsec/audit-check`
  tried to publish its Check Run result. The audit itself was passing
  (0 vulnerabilities found, our `RUSTSEC-2026-0235` ignore working
  correctly); the job had no `permissions:` block at all, so it inherited
  read-only default permissions instead of the `checks: write` the action
  needs. Added the missing `permissions:` block.
- `release.yml` never set `prerelease` on published GitHub releases —
  `softprops/action-gh-release` defaults to `false`, so both
  `v1.0.0-beta.1` and `v1.0.0-beta.2` published as (and one incorrectly
  displayed as "Latest") full stable releases despite being betas. Added
  tag-based auto-detection (`-` suffix ⇒ prerelease), matching
  `tabularis`'s own `release.yml` convention, plus `make_latest` wired to
  the same check so only an actual stable tag can become "Latest".
  Retroactively corrected both already-published releases via
  `gh release edit --prerelease`.
- Three of the new CI jobs above failed on their first real run and were
  fixed:
  - `Test` job: the existing `cargo test` (no target filter) tried to run
    `tests/live_db.rs` too, which panics immediately without a running
    PostgreSQL instance. Scoped to `cargo test --lib --bins`, leaving the
    live-DB test to its own dedicated `live-db-integration` job.
  - `Markdown lint` job: `docs/planning/.markdownlint.json`'s scoped
    override (`MD024`/`MD060`) only applied when markdownlint was invoked
    from within that directory — the CI step's root-level `**/*.md` glob
    never picked it up. Merged the scoped overrides into the single root
    `.markdownlint.json` instead of maintaining two config files. Also
    added `.markdownlintignore` (`target/`) since the glob was
    incidentally linting vendored third-party docs copied into build
    output by a dependency's build script.
  - `Security audit` job: `cargo audit` correctly found a real advisory,
    RUSTSEC-2026-0235 (vulnerable `rkyv` 0.7.46) — but it's pulled in only
    because `rust_decimal` lists it as an optional dependency behind a
    feature (`rkyv`) we never enable; confirmed no `rkyv` symbols are
    linked into the release binary. Added a documented `ignore:` entry for
    that specific advisory ID, since `cargo audit` scans the full
    `Cargo.lock` graph regardless of which optional features are active.

- `main.rs` rewritten to a worker-pool architecture (4 workers + a single
  writer task + a dedicated pool-cleanup task, coordinated via a
  `tokio::sync::watch` shutdown signal on stdin EOF), matching the
  sqlserver/dynamodb sibling plugins. A slow query on one connection no
  longer blocks a concurrent `ping` or metadata call on another; the host
  already tolerates out-of-order responses (it correlates by JSON-RPC `id`
  via a `HashMap`, not arrival order), so this required no protocol change.
- Periodic idle-pool eviction: every 10 minutes, `client::cleanup_idle_pools()`
  drops cached connection pools that currently have no checked-out
  connections, so a long-running session that has connected to many
  distinct targets doesn't pin idle TCP connections and pool memory for
  the plugin's lifetime. Matches the sqlserver/dynamodb sibling plugins'
  pattern exactly (`pool.status().size > pool.status().available` as the
  keep predicate). Found missing during the same security-audit pass that
  flagged "pool cleanup on shutdown" — investigation showed the host never
  sends the plugin a `shutdown` RPC call at all (it kills the process
  outright), so that specific checklist wording described something
  unreachable; comparing sibling plugins surfaced this as the real,
  exercisable gap instead. Added test-first (TDD): a unit test asserting
  an idle pool gets evicted, written and confirmed RED (`cleanup_idle_pools`
  didn't exist) before the function was implemented to GREEN.
- `save_blob_to_file` now validates `file_path` (empty, existing-directory,
  or missing-parent-directory) before spending a DB round-trip on a write
  that would fail anyway — a clearly attributed `-32602` error instead of
  a bare OS error number surfacing after the query already ran. Not a
  security boundary (the path comes from the frontend's native save
  dialog), just a fast-fail. The builtin driver's identical gap is
  untouched; this fix is plugin-only. Found during the security-audit pass.
- `startup_script` support: SQL supplied on the connection now runs on every
  new pooled connection via a `deadpool-postgres` `post_create` hook, with a
  preflight validation pass so a broken script fails fast with a clearly
  attributed `Startup script failed: ...` error instead of a misleading
  connection error. Matches the builtin driver's
  `run_postgres_startup_script` behavior (`src-tauri/src/pool_manager.rs`).
  Found missing during a security-audit pass — no parity test exercises
  this field, so the 82/82 parity suite didn't catch the gap.
- `connection_string` support: when present, it's parsed via
  `tokio_postgres::Config::from_str` and takes precedence over the discrete
  host/port/database/username/password fields, matching the README's
  documented behavior. Previously the field was parsed into
  `ConnectionParams` but silently never consumed by `build_pool()`. Also
  found during the security-audit pass.
- Plugin source (`Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, `.tabularium`, `src/`) imported
  from `TabularisDB/tabularis`'s `plugins/postgres-plugin/` at commit
  `ad765f3a` (82/82 parity tests green per that commit). This is a parallel
  copy — the in-tree source has not been removed, and the two copies are
  kept in sync manually pending a later decision to deprecate the in-tree
  copy.
- `docs/planning/`: the 8 design documents that shaped this migration
  (phase docs, both migration-plan variants, and the feature-gap audit
  feeding Phase 2), copied from `tabularis`'s `.github/planning/`.
- `src/lib.rs` and `src/bin/test_plugin.rs`: extracted the plugin's module
  tree into a library crate so the justfile's `repl` recipe (a local
  JSON-RPC REPL) has a real binary to run, matching the oracle/dynamodb
  sibling plugins' structure.
- Repo scaffolding: `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0), `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`,
  `CODEOWNERS`, `rust-toolchain.toml` (pinning `rustfmt`/`clippy`),
  `.github/dependabot.yml`, `justfile` (build/test/lint/fmt/dev-install/
  demo-db recipes, matching sibling plugin repos).
- `CI` workflow (`cargo build`/`test`/`clippy`/`fmt --check`) and `Release`
  workflow (cross-platform binary builds for Linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS
  x86_64/aarch64, Windows x86_64, published as GitHub release assets
  alongside `.tabularium`).
- `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` describing the plugin's purpose, architecture,
  and current migration status.

### Changed

- `.tabularium`'s `name` field changed from `postgres-plugin` to
  `postgresql` (and the redundant `id` field dropped) to match this repo's
  own install-path/executable naming and the sibling-plugin convention of a
  bare engine-name slug. This field is a permanent registry slug once
  published, so it was fixed before any release.
- README's connection config table: `ssl_ca`/`ssl_cert`/`ssl_key` were
  documented as a single group ("If using `verify-ca`/`verify-full`"), but
  only `ssl_ca` (custom CA pinning) is actually implemented — matches the
  builtin PostgreSQL driver, which also has no client-certificate support
  (unlike its MySQL driver). Documentation corrected to describe only what
  the plugin (and builtin) actually do.
